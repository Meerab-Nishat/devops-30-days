# 🧰 Linux Automation Toolkit (Week 1)

This toolkit contains Linux automation scripts and projects built during Week 1 of my DevOps learning journey.

##  Components

###  Reusable Scripts (`/scripts`)
- `disk-check.sh` → Monitors disk usage
- `system_health.sh` → Reports system health (CPU, memory, disk)
- `loop-demo.sh` → Bash looping practice

These scripts are designed to be reused across servers and projects.

---

###  Projects (`/projects`)

####  Automated Backup Script
Location: `projects/backup-scripts`

**Features**
- Timestamped compressed backups
- Logging
- Disk safety checks
- Structured source / backups / logs directories

This simulates a real-world server backup automation task.
