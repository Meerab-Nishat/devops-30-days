# Day 13 – Docker Volumes & Persistence

## What I Learned
- Containers are temporary
- Volumes store data outside containers
- PostgreSQL data persists after restarts
- docker volume ls and inspect commands

## Reflection
Volumes are essential for production workloads.
Without them, databases would lose data.
