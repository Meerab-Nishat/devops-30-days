# Day 7 – Week 1 Reflection

## What I Built
- Reusable Linux automation scripts
- A real backup automation project
- A clean, structured DevOps repository

## Key Realization
DevOps is not about writing many scripts, but about organizing, documenting, and maintaining automation.

## Outcome
I can now read, write, and explain Linux automation scripts with confidence.
